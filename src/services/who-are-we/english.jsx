	<p>
		The Franco Spanish humanitarian Association Pipilet Mandala
		(www.AHFE-pipiletmandala.org), which
		has its head-office in France, is composed of a French and Spanish
		Management team. Our mission is to
		unite these 2 countries in order to increase solidarity and improve quality
		of life for the most vulnerable
		people on earth.
	</p>

	<p>“I will tell you how this idea came to me and how this project started
		thanks to a Franco-Spanish group of
		people who believed in me and my project. Without them, this humanitarian
		charity association would not
		exist.
	</p>

	<p>Personally, I was a Social Worker for 15 years in Spain. I can say that I
		have been interested in social
		services since I was a child. In a way this really helped me with the
		setting up of the Franco-Spanish
		charity “Pipilet Mandala”.
	</p>

	<p>In addition to being a social worker, I am a teacher. On the base, of these
		two interests was born “Pipilet
		Mandala”, a kids’ mascot. Whom better than children, our future, could
		understand this wonderful idea?
	</p>

	<p>Thanks to the way I see and feel the world, I believe that one of the most
		“ down-to-earth” animals is the
		snail. This imaginary snail is special: he is alien and brings with him a
		universal message of love. He
		comes from a yet-to-be discovered planet, called “Galappar”. He would like
		to travel the world, discover
		its countries, cultures, history, music, food and make friends with
		everybody.</p>

	<p>However, because he doesn’t speak our language, he will need to go to
		school like any kid to learn to
		speak and to learn about a whole lot of other subjects.
	</p>

	<p>To achieve our aims, we decided to create an educational website for kids.
		Thanks to “Pipilet Mandala”
		our universal message can be delivered fast.
		There are be 12 languages on our website, with all the mascot’s learning
		subjects: music, food, and
		school.</p>

	<p>This page has been translated in 3 languages (Spanish, French, English).
		Its aim is to bring a universal
		message of love. Thanks to a number of videos, it will be possible to find
		sentences of solidarity and
		universality in 12 languages.
	</p>

	<p>Why the use of Mandala? Mandala is an integral part of the mascot’s name
		because of its meaning. The
		word “Mandala” comes from Sanskrit and literally means “ sacred circle”. It
		is a symbol of healing, union
		and integration.</p>

	<p>On a psychological level, mandalas represent the whole of our being.
		Everybody reacts to it instinctively,
		above their years, gender, their origin or culture. It is a vector
		permitting the wisdom of our conscience.
	</p>

	<p>Pipilet Mandala is more than our mascot, it is a international humanitarian
		project.
	</p>

	<p>
		Thanks to this mascot, we are creating our humanitarian project to raise
		funds and reach our objectif ( to
		develop solidarity and improve quality of life for the most vulnerable
		people on earth). This will be done
		also thanks to our solidarity shopping website (http://
		www.mode-pipiletmandala.org).
	</p>

	<p>
		I thank you for helping us realise our dream.
